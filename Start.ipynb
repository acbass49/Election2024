    "\n",
    "First, I need to build the model. I may have to import data from another place and it would be best to just build the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "I think I'll start with some simple feature engineering. I will use polling house and recency as independent variables. Perhaps I will use the previous day as a weak prior for the model to add a sort or smoothing time series compenent effect? I may have to do a little research on forcasting/time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "I should write-up my methodology like last time and have it on my github in a quarto doc\n",
    "\n",
    "For the model itself, I'll estimate a logistic regression to output probabilities for each state.\n",
    "\n",
    "After I build the model and dashboard, This will be the daily update pipeline:\n",
    "1. Combine and feature engineer data\n",
    "2. Re-estimate model using yesterdays estimates as weak priors\n",
    "3. Add the new numbers to the dashboard and refresh website\n",
    "\n",
    "### What should I include in the dashboard?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The line which tracks over time the overall predictions/probabilities for the race (interactive).\n",
    "2. Map of the states and their probabilities (interactive).\n",
    "3. Histogram of the simulations that day (interactive? maybe static)\n",
    "4. X latest polls and some basic info in a table (static with hyperlinks).\n"
